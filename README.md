# Image Transformation Analysis

This Python script demonstrates image transformation analysis by separating an image into nine regions, applying transformations to each part separately, and then aggregating the results for comparison with other experiments.

## Description

The script implements a scientific approach to analyze image transformations. It divides the image into nine distinct regions and applies individual transformations to each segment. Finally, it combines the transformed parts to facilitate comparison with other experimental outcomes.

## Features

- **Image Partitioning**: The script partitions the image into nine regions, providing a detailed analysis at a granular level.
- **Transformation Application**: It applies transformations to each part separately, ensuring precise and targeted adjustments.


## Usage

1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies, if any, using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. View the output, including the transformed image and any comparison results.

## Dependencies
- `skimage`: Provides image processing functionality, such as reading and writing images, histogram equalization, and exposure adjustment.
- `numpy`: Used for numerical operations and array manipulation.
- `matplotlib`: Used for visualization and plotting histograms.
